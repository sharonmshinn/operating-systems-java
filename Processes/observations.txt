Assignment #2

The consumer's sum is very dependent on the amount of seconds the producer has to wait. 
If the producer ends up waiting more and the consumer ends up waiting less, the sum will
be much larger than if the producer waits less than the consumer because the global 
variable is originally set to 100. 

This assignment has taught me that based on this approach, we cannot assume that the 
output will be similar, and if we want to produce the same results using random 
number generator and threads, we would most likely have to use some sort of wait
function.

This assignment took me roughly an hour to code, test, and properly document.
