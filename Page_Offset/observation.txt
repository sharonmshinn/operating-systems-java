Assignment #4

This assignment has taught me about how to calculate page number and offset for a given address with certain restrictions. 
Memory size is equal to KB, which is 1024, times the number of KBs. In order to find page, you would calculate the address 
divided by the memory size. In order to find the offset, you would do address modulo memory size, which would give a remainder. 
This assignment was fairly straight-forward, so not much time was spent for this assignment. 

This assignment took about an hour and a half to code, test, and document.
